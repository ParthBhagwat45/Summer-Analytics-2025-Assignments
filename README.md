Project Overview:This repository presents the solution for the Summer Analytics 2025 course project. The objective was to perform end-to-end analysis using modern data science tools to solve a real-world problem. The work showcases skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model development, and documentation.

Course Structure
The course was structured into weekly modules:
Data Preparation and Cleaning,
ML Foundations and Regularization,
Streaming Data and Classification,
Advanced ML & Deep Learning,
Unsupervised Learning + Industry Talks

Tech Stack Used:Python 3.x,pandas, numpy,matplotlib, seaborn,scikit-learn,Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub
